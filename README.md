Mordac
======

Mordac, the restorer of Dilbert RSS feeds.

What?
-----

Mordac the Preventer of Information Services has changed the
[offical Dilbert RSS feeds][] to be [completely useless][].

Of course, he has kept a tool for making a proper RSS (Atom, actually)
feed for himself. We're now sharing it with you.

Usage
-----

1. Clone this repository somewhere.
2. Go to the checked out folder.
3. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
4. Run `npn run mordac` to fetch data and generate the feed.
5. Find your new `atom.xml` file in the `public` folder.
